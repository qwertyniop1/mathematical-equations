          ' linear equation
        ' is an algebraic equation in which each term is either
        ' a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single
        ' variable. A simple example of a linear equation with only one variable, `x`,
        ' may be written in the form: `ax + b = 0`, where a and b are constants and
        ' `a â‰  0`. The constants may be numbers, parameters, or even non-linear
        ' functions of parameters, and the distinction between variables and
        ' parameters may depend on the problem.
