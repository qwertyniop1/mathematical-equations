    ' linear equation
  ' is an algebraic equation in which each term is either
  ' a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single
  ' variable. A simple example of a linear equation with only one variable, `x`,
  ' may be written in the form: `ax + b = 0`, where a and b are constants and
  ' `a â‰  0`. The constants may be numbers, parameters, or even non-linear
  ' functions of parameters, and the distinction between variables and
  ' parameters may depend on the problem.
